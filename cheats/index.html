						(SCI), which has been going on strong since May 30th,
						2019. Its predecessor was "SurvivCheat" and even more
						before that was "Megamod" which started in January 2018.
						SCI is just the injector for the actual SurvivCheat
						which has stayed remotely the same since it's
						introduction. Today the latest version (<ice-version
						></ice-version>) has
						<ice-downloads></ice-downloads> downloads.

						A dead project. The IceHacks team doesn't like the game
						Krunker much.

					<ice-box title="Shellshock Cheat Injector">
						A project that never really got off the ground due to
						SCI taking up much time.
