						The main IceHacks project is <a href="https://github.com/IceHacks/SurvivCheatInjector">SurvivCheatInjector</a> (SCI) which
						has been going on strong since May 30th, 2019. Its predecessor was "SurvivCheat" which never
						was on GitHub and started November 2018, before that was Megamod which only stayed a while on
						Github and started in January 2018.
						SCI is just an injector for the actual SurvivCheat which has stayed remotely the
						same since it's introduction. Today around a thousand people visit the SCI page each day.
						The latest version (<ice-version></ice-version>) has <ice-downloads></ice-downloads> downloads.

					<ice-box title="Krunker Cheat Injector" url="https://github.com/IceHacks/KrunkerCheatInjector">
						A dead project only dead due to lack of motivation to update it. The IceHacks team doesn't like
						Krunker much.
