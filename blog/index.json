Me and my testers have been using it often for the past month. \n\nHere is a sample of the new features it has:\n\n- Surviv.io performance upgrades\n    - this is several upgrades to surviv.io's code to let it run more smoothly\n- Better AimBot\n    - with the correct settings, you will be hitting the shots when it matters most\n- AutoEmote\n- Improved AutoSwitching\n- FidgetMode\n    - like SpinBot, but random\n- and much, much more to come\n\nStay tuned and stay happy.",
