						IceHacks is both a person and an organization,
						the father of "IceHacks", as we now know it, is an anonymous donor of cheats, <i>a man of
							mystery</i>, unknown to the public, and highly un-credited.
						IceHacks started in 2018 and has gone through several changes since,
						although that anonymous person has been in the business for a long time.
						Even though it is mainly focused on <a href="http://surviv.io/">surviv.io</a>, IceHacks has made
						cheats for several other games (web, desktop, ...all things) those cheats are long forgotten and
						never surfaced much.
						IceHacks strives to meet users' expectations and loves to see happy people.
						If you have any suggestions, comments, or questions you can contact us via <a
						   href="mailto:icehacksofficial@gmail.com?subject=From%20website%3A%20">email</a> or <a
						   href="tel:413-337-7759">phone*</a>. <br>
						<br>
						<small>* SMS supported and prefered. Probably will go to voicemail as our hours are
							wack.</small>
